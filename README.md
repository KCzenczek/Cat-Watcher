# Cat-Watcher

"Catwatcher" is a  simply application based on Flask and written in Python.

1. Structural assumptions

a. Mobility
A four-wheel-drive rover will allow you to overcome minor obstacles in the home environment, such as getting onto a carpet, passing through a door;
Possibility of finding the cat object throughout the apartment.

b. Observation
Camera settled on a structure, moved by two servos, allows to observe the cat object depending on its location (assuming the object was not hiding in the wardrobe).

c. Motion detection
PIR sensor detects movement of any object (not only the cat)  in the range of 7m, with a viewing angle of up to 100 Â°.

d. power supply
Raspberry Pi Zero W - Power Bank 
Motors & servos - rechargeable batteries 

e. Construction
Lightweight construction of Lego blocks :)


2. Functional assumptions

Laptop and RPi connected by SSH.
Rover and camera control through keyboard.
